    There are two sub graphs of the Sea of Nodes There is a Control Flow Graph, 
that is represented by certain node types, Start, If Region, etc. Then there is 
the data graph, driven by def-use edges between nodes that produce or consume 
values. From a scheduling standpoint the control flow graph is fixed and immovable. 
however the nodes that consume or produce data values must have some flexability in 
terms of when they are executed. 

    The scheduling algorithm works in two phases. First Is schedule early - in this
phase we do a depth first search walk on the inputs starting from the stop node. we
schedule each data node to the first control block wehere they are dominated by their 
inputs

    The second phase is schedule late, in this phase we do a downward walk (DFS) on 
the outputs starting from the top at the start node, and move data nodes to a block
between the first block calculated above, and the last control block where they dominated
all ehtir usese. The placement is subject to the condiditon that is is in the shalowest
loop nest possilbe and is as control dependent as possible. Additionaly the placement of load
instruction must ensure correct ording between loads and stores of the same memory location.
